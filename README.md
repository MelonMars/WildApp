This app allows users to partake in challenges. There are daily challenges, social, adventure, and creative. Users can choose not to do challenges and get sent to the coward page, and they can view the gallery of other users' posts, where they can comment or like them. They can also filter by location and view other users' profiles and submissions, send friend requests, and share challenges with other users. They can also gain achievements and improve their streaks. Additionally, they can create their own challenge.

To set this up yourself, run the sql commands in the backend directory in Supabase or another provider of your choosing, and then modify my project with the settings of yours in the supabase context. Then you can run it with `npx expo run --go` and use your own backend.
